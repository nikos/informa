<p>This package contains definition of Persistence Manager interface. It
    also holds configuration class (PersistentManagerConfig), which should
    be used to establish instances of managers indirectly.</p>

<p>Persistence Manager is a front-end for persistence model implemented
    in Informa. It provides convenient and implementation independend ways
    to operate with data located in persistent storage. Different
    implementations of interface can be provided to support different
    types of storage (Memory, Database, plain and XML files, etc).</p>

<p>Concrete implementations of manager interface reside deeper in
    package hierarchy, but can be easily moved anywhere in code.</p>

<p><b>Note for Persistence Manager implementation developers!</b><br>
    There's an acceptance test developed to help you with making sure
    that your implementation does what's expected. When you develop your
    own implementation make sure that it passes at least the acceptance test.
    In order to do so you should create your own test case and extend
    <code>TestAbstractPersistenceManager</code> with it, like below.</p>

<pre>
<code>
    // header skipped
    package de.nava.informa.utils.manager.memory;

    // imports skipped

    /**
    * In-Memory persistence manager test.
    *
    * @see PersistenceManager
    * @author Aleksey Gureev (spyromus@noizeramp.com)
    */
    public class TestMemoryPersistenceManager extends TestAbstractPersistenceManager {
    /**
    * Returns manager to be tested.
    *
    * @return manager to be tested.
    */
    protected PersistenceManagerIF getManager() {
    return new PersistenceManager();
    }
    }
</code>
</pre>

<p>You can see that this is very simple. If you need your own additional
    tests to be run then just put them below as usual.</p>
