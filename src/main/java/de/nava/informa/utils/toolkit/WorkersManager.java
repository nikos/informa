/**
 * This class manages worker threads. Its main responsibility is to create / remove worker threads
 * and distribute tasks among them. This is an effort to hide complexity of threading logic from
 * the rest of toolkit. Worker manager receives processing requests from external tools and assigns
 * them to free worker threads. If there's no free worker thread left manager puts item in queue.
 * When worker thread finishes its job it asks for next job using <code>JobSource</code> callback
 * interface. If there is at least one job in queue manager assigns it to worker. If not then
 * worker goes to rest until manager has something to assign.
 * <p>
 * Worker manager uses instance of <code>WorkerThreadFactoryIF</code> specified on creation
 * to create new worker threads. Client application should use it to create and initialize
 * task-specific workers, which will be started as independent threads.</p>
 * <p>
 * It's possible to tune number of threads working at a given time using
 * <code>setWorkerThreads(int)</code> method call. Right after the number of threads will change
 * manager will stop unnecessary threads (only after running task completion) or create
 * new worker threads.</p>
