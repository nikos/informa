<description>Reuters - Federal Reserve officials opted on
Tuesday to keep U.S. interest rates at 1958 lows and said they

out of concern inflation could drift undesirably low.
The central bank&#039;s policy-setting Federal Open Market
Committee, as expected, said it had left the benchmark federal
funds rate at 1 percent, a 45-year low hit after the Fed cut
rates 13 times since early 2001 in an effort to foster a
vigorous expansion.</description>
