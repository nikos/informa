    <title>New Toolbar, Ad Sizes</title>

    <description>Google has released Google Toolbar 2.0 which has several interesting new features including a BlogThis button, a pop-up blocker, and AutoFill. It&apos;s interesting to see that Google is providing more generic Web utilities and less Google-specific stuff. I guess now that Microsoft has announced they won&apos;t continue to update Internet Explorer, it&apos;s up to Google to provide these important features.

    <title>Big News! New Google Operator</title>
    <link>http://google.blogspace.com/archives/001018</link>
    <description>From Google Spokesperson, Nate Tyler:Today, Google introduced a new advanced search feature that enables users to search not only for a particular keyword, but also for its synonyms. This is accomplished by placing a ~ character directly in front of the keyword in the search box. For example, to search for browser help as well as browser guides and tutorials users can search for browser ~help. The ~ character was chosen because it&apos;s shorthand for approximate and a good way for users to express their wish to expand searches to include synonyms. More information about this feature is available. This enhancement shows that Google continuies to develop new resources that enable users to refine their searches to find the information they need. I hope you find the ~ operator useful - please take a look and let me know if you have any questions....</description>
