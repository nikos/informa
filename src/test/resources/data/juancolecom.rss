      <description>&lt;b&gt;1 US Soldier Dead in Tikrit, One Wounded; Baghdad Shaken by blasts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guerrillas detonated an improvised explosive device near Tikrit on Monday, killing one soldier with the 4th Infantry Division and wounding another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Iraqis were killed and six wounded in Kirkuk when mortars fell on a civilian neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Balad in the north, US troops killed 6 innocent Iraqis when they opened fire on a vehicle they thought belonged to guerrillas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Baquba, one Iraqi was killed and six were wounded when a roadside bomb went off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, late reports said that Baghdad residents heard five loud explosions one after the other from 9:10 pm Monday, appearing to originate on the western side of the Tigris River.  The US military then reported three or four mortar impacts in central Baghdad.  No word on casualties as I write early Tuesday morning EST.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Bomb in Karbala kills 3, wounds 12&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A car bomb exploded in the Shiite holy city of Karbala on Monday not far from the sacred shrine of Imam Husayn, the martyred grandson of the Prophet Muhammad.  It killed 3 persons and injured 12, all passers-by.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One report said the bomb went off near a hostel used by Iranian pilgrims, but it is hard for me to think of anyone but Baathists who would have a motive for trying to kill them.  Many people in Karbala depend directly or indirectly on the pilgrim trade for their income. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Karbala has been shaken in recent weeks by internecine fighting among Shiite factions seeking to control the shrine.  But the car bomb does not obviously serve either side in that cause, and is more likely intended to hurt the popularity of the US and the Coalition forces, who will be blamed by the Shiites in Karbala and throughout the world for failing to provide sufficient security to the shrine city.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Chief Judge of Najaf,  Kidnapped, Executed; Baghdad Official Killed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chief judge in the Shiite shrine city of Najaf was kidnapped Monday, taken to the desert, and executed gangland style with bullets through his head. Judge Muhan Jabr al-Shuwaili had been in charge of investigating former Baath Party members and government employees in the region.  Najaf prosecutor-general Aref Aziz was kidnapped with al-Shuwaili and reported, &lt;i&gt;&quot;&quot;One of the assailants said ‘Saddam has ordered your prosecution.’ Then they fired two shots into his head,&quot; Aziz said. &quot;As for me, they told me ‘this does not concern you’. They released me,&quot; he added.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al-Shuwaili had backed a commission to investigate the crimes of former Baathists, which has already issued 160 warrants, resulting in 50 actual arrests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, on Sunday assailants had sprayed machine gun fire from a car at the American-appointed head of Karkh II borough in Baghdad, the biggest of the capital's neighborhoods, killing Mustafa Zaidan al-Khalifah, 47.  On October 28, another US-appointed Baghdad municipal official, Faris Abd al-Razzaq, had been assassinated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other officials narrowly escaped a similar fate on Monday.  The director of the Najaf city council (an official of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq) just managed to avoid being killed, though no details were forthcoming.  Likewise, the governor of Diyala and his lieutenant governor just managed to escape gunfire directed at their automobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There had been reports last week that some US officers in Iraq believe that Saddam is personally directing some guerrilla operations in Iraq.  I have for some time thought that Saddam may have personally been behind the assassination of his old enemy, Ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim, on Aug. 29.  If Aref's report of the fate of al-Shuwaili is accurate, it supports this interpretation of events.  It is also a pretty scary thought. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this rate, it may be increasingly difficult for the US to find Iraqis willing to work with it as officials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(al-Zaman, AFP).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <link>http://www.juancole.com/</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Police Riot in Basra&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 200 police gathered in front of the British Headquarters in Basra Monday to protest a reduction in their salaries from $160 a month to only $60 a month.  At one point they rushed the offices of the chief British officials, and came to blows with British guards.  The British troops fired over their heads, wounding one man slightly.  The demonstration ended when the British permitted a delegation of 7 of them men to come into the building and negotiate with British authorities. (al-Zaman)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basra has been quiet since major riots in August, despite occasional resprisal killings of former Baathists and some tribal feuds.  The British administration of the city must be running out of funds for them to do something so unwise as to cut the pay of the Iraqi police so drastically.  That decision was a riot waiting to happen, and it points to some sort of fiscal desperation on the part of Coalition authorities, about which we are not hearing in the mainstream press.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Barwari: Half of Iraqis lack Clean Water&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nasrin Barwari, interim Minister of Municipalities and Public Works, said that half of Iraq's 25 million people had no access to clean water.  She expressed her disappointment Monday that the United Nations and so many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) were abandoning Iraq.  She said they were desperately needed for reconstruction.  She noted that some NGOs were continuing to operate in Iraq via their local, Iraqi employees, even though international ones had left..  She hit an upbeat note when she said that in the coming year, for the first time in history Iraq's government would spend $5-6 billion on services, the money coming from the US, international donors, and Iraq's petroleum receipts.

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Afghani Constitution Mandates Women's Seats in Parliament&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The announcement that the new draft Afghanistan constitution recognizes Islam as the religion of the state has provoked a great deal of discussion in the West.  But lots of Western countries have a state religion.  The UK does, in the form of Anglicanism, and the British monarch is the &quot;defender of the Faith.&quot;  The US and France have constitutions that separate religion and state, but most countries are not that clear about the issue.  Even in Italy there has recently been a public dispute about whether state schools may display crucifixes, and most Italians seem to think they should be able to.  Indeed, many legislators wanted to put in the constitution of the new European Union that Europe had a primarily Christian heritage.  In Poland the Catholic church was given the right to vet television channel licenses.  In Greece, Greek Orthodox priests get to decide if Muslims may build a new mosque, and it is illegal for anyone but Orthodox priests to proselytize.  We could bring up Ireland, Bolivia, etc., etc.  Westerners are not as secular in law as they think they are.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few commentators have noted the provision for women's seats in both houses of parliament.  One woman must be elected to the lower house from each province.  The President will appoint one-third of the members of the upper house of parliament, and half of those must be women.  So one-sixth of senators will be women at the least.  Afghanistan's women are likely to end up being better represented in parliament than American women in Congress.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;3 Americans Killed in addition to the dead from the Helicopter Attack&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guerrillas killed a soldier of the 1st Armored Division with an improvised explosive device in Baghdad Sunday.  In Fallujah, guerrillas set off a roadside bomb as two civilian contractors passed by, killing both.  They were working for the US Army Corps of Engineers.  These deaths came in addition to the 16 US soldiers killed when guerrillas fired a missile at a transport helicopter. Some 20 others were wounded.&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;51% of Americans Disapprove of Bush's Iraq Policy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An ABC News-Washington Post poll released Sunday:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Percentage of Americans who disapprove of Bush administation policy in Iraq: 51&lt;br /&gt;Percentage who approve: 47&lt;br /&gt;Percentage who think Bush has made the US more prosperous:  less than 10&lt;br /&gt;Percentage who say Bush cannot understand their problems:  58&lt;br /&gt;Percentage who disapprove of Bush's handling of the economy: 53&lt;br /&gt;Percentage who think the economy is more important than terrorism as an issue: 62&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the most important statistic in this set is that 58% say Bush cannot understand their problems.  All the folksy Texas malapropisms in the world have not been able to convince ordinary Americans that this prince from a Northeast finance and political dynasty is one of them.  What gave it away?  It wasn't the huge tax giveaways to the rich.  Americans seldom mind rich people getting breaks, since they all plan on being rich themselves one day.  It was that princes can get consumed by foreign wars in distant places, but ordinary Americans can seldom focus on such things longer than a year or two, more especially when their economic situation is faltering.  Bush is giving away their money to foreigners, and sacrificing their boys to a foreign adventure.  The failure to find weapons of mass destruction has demonstrated to people that it hadn't been necessary to the country's defense.  And there is only one word in the lexicon of ordinary Americans for an expensive  foreign war that didn't need to be fought, and that is boondoggle.</description>

Guerrillas tossed hand grenades at the pipeline, according to AFP.  Eyewitness Hassan Messarhad remarked, &lt;i&gt;&quot;I heard a powerful explosion in the evening, and I saw huge flames coming out of the oil pipeline.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;.  A gas pipeline near Baiji had been hit on Saturday.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Foreign Ministers of Neighboring Countries Meet in Damascus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The six neighbors of Iraq (with the addition of Egypt) met in Damascus over the weekend, and issued a joint statement condemning terror attacks against civilians and NGOs.  They also asked that a timeline be announced for the return of sovereignty to the Iraqi people.  Turkey had wanted to put in an explicit warning about the Marxist Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) using northern Iraq as a guerrilla base against Turkey, and Iran wanted to prohibit any anti-Iran activities by the terrorist group, Mujahidin-i Khalq Organization, which Saddam had hosted in eastern Iraq.  The other neighbors, however, declined to allow the PKK and the MKO to be named explicitly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mujahidin-i Khalq, which has murdered hundreds of Iranians in terrorist attacks, has been defended by prominent rightwing figure Daniel Pipes, whom President Bush recently appointed to the US Institute for Peace.  Tehran may fear a Neoconservative/MKO alliance with Iraq as a springboard for further terrorism against Iran.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Talabani Pledges Militias will Join Iraqi Army&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jalal Talabani, head of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and current president of the Interim Governing Council, pledged that his paramilitary forces would be melded into the national Iraqi army eventually,  In an interview with al-Zaman, he again urged a Federal system on Iraq, such that both provincial and federal prerogatives would be safeguarded.  He looked forward to the emergence of religious pilgrimage (especially Shiite pilgrimage to the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala) as a major industry in Iraq, generating substantial sums for the country.  (He is right about that, and it shows how Iraq-minded the Kurdish leaders are that he focused on that, since the Shiite south is far from his ordinary purview.)  He also stressed that he thought Egypt had a major role to play in Iraq reconstruction, especially Egyptian firms.  (In fact, Egypt has been too worried about the security situation to play a major role in post-war Iraq, and al-Zaman quoted the Eygptian minister of labor today as saying that it was not time to send Egyptian workers to Iraq).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a related point, al-Sharq al-Awsat ran a long editorial today on the announced plans of the Shiite Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq to disarm its paramilitary branch, the Badr Brigade.  The paper argued that this step was necessary for democracy in Iraq.  That is right, but the problem is that the disarming of this militia has been announced repeatedly and yet they still show up in news reports as armed.  So this is something I'll believe when I see it.  The Badr Corps was trained by the Iranian revolutionary guards, and many political forces inside Iraq, as well as neighbors such as Jordan, are afraid of it.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Mudarrisi:  Avoid Conflict&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ayatollah Muhammad Taqi Mudarrisi modified his recent demand that US troops leave the country immediately, according to al-Sharq al-Awsat.  The cleric said that the Coalition troops would not stay long in Iraq, since that was neither something the Iraqi people want nor something in the interests of the Coalition.  In the meantime, he said, what is needed is to avoid conflict and violence.  It sounds as though someone in the US military had a little talk with Mudarrisi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also on Sunday, Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani met with Ibrahim Jaafari, a leader of the Shiite al-Da`wa Party and member of the Interim Governing Council.  The two issued no statement, but presumably the IGC wants something from Sistani and was seeking it.  Sistani has enormous moral authority with Iraqi Shiites.</description>

      <title>Bremer Imposes Flat Tax on IraqPaul Bremer continu ...</title>
      <link>http://billmon.org/archives/000846.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Bremer Imposes Flat Tax on Iraq&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Bremer continues to use Iraq as an economic guinea pig, and has now implemented the &quot;flat tax&quot; idea beloved of the US wealthy by fiat.  Flat taxes are regressive, since they tax the rich at the same rate as they tax the poor.  Someone making a million dollars a year would pay $150,000 in Federal taxes at a 15% flat tax rate, leaving him with $850,000.  Someone making $20,000 a year would pay $3,000, leaving her with $17,000.  This is a way for the rich to avoid contributing their fair share to national needs such as interstate highways, airports, Homeland Security, and other Federal responsibilities.  Since nearly 50 percent of the privately held wealth in the US is owned by the top one percent of the population, taxing them at the same rate as everyone else ensures that much of the country's wealth is not available for key societal needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out, however, a flat tax in an oil state like Iraq is probably irrelevant anyway.  In petroleum states, the real question is how the state shares the oil income with the citizenry.  Taxation isn't the big issue, unless the petroleum industry is privatized (not likely--Bremer needs the income).  Bremer has spoken well of the Alaska arrangement for citizen dividends from petroleum, and if that is implemented it will more than make up for the regressiveness of the new tax system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, as Billmon points out, it is still illegal for Bremer to change Iraq all around at will.  Section 3, Art. 48 of the Hague Regulations of 1907 clearly say &lt;i&gt;&quot;If, in the territory occupied, the occupant collects the taxes, dues, and tolls imposed for the benefit of the State, he shall do so, as far as is possible, in accordance with the rules of assessment and incidence in force . . .&quot;&lt;/i&gt;  Since the rules of assessment in force under the Baath were not the flat tax, the Occupying Power does not have the right to introduce a flat tax.&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, Section 3, Art. 43 says, &lt;i&gt;&quot;The authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.&lt;/i&gt;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Billmon's comments see:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://billmon.org/archives/000846.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://billmon.org/&lt;br /&gt;archives/000846.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For general issues in the law of occupation with regard to Iraq:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://electroniciraq.net/news/660.shtml&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://electroniciraq.net/&lt;br /&gt;news/660.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the Hague Regulations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/&lt;br /&gt;avalon/lawofwar/hague04.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the CPA seems not to have a copy at hand, here are the relevant passages in case any of the surfs this site from Baghdad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hague Regulations of 1907:&lt;br /&gt;SECTION III&lt;br /&gt;MILITARY AUTHORITY OVER THE TERRITORY&lt;br /&gt;OF THE HOSTILE STATE&lt;br /&gt;Art. 42. Territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the hostile army.&lt;br /&gt;The occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has been established and can be exercised.&lt;br /&gt;Art. 43. The authority of the legitimate power having in fact passed into the hands of the occupant, the latter shall take all the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety, &lt;b&gt;while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art. 44. A belligerent is forbidden to force the inhabitants of territory occupied by it to furnish information about the army of the other belligerent, or about its means of defense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Art. 45. It is forbidden to compel the inhabitants of occupied territory to swear allegiance to the hostile Power.&lt;br /&gt;Art. 46. Family honour and rights, the lives of persons, and private property, as well as religious convictions and practice, must be respected.&lt;br /&gt;Private property cannot be confiscated.&lt;br /&gt;Art. 47. Pillage is formally forbidden.&lt;br /&gt;Art. 48. If, in the territory occupied, the occupant collects the taxes, dues, and tolls imposed for the benefit of the State, &lt;b&gt;he shall do so, as far as is possible, in accordance with the rules of assessment and incidence in force,&lt;/b&gt; and shall in consequence be bound to defray the expenses of the administration of the occupied territory to the same extent as the legitimate Government was so bound.&lt;br /&gt;Art. 49. If, in addition to the taxes mentioned in the above article, the occupant levies other money contributions in the occupied territory, this shall only be for the needs of the army or of the administration of the territory in question.&lt;br /&gt;Art. 50. No general penalty, pecuniary or otherwise, shall be inflicted upon the population on account of the acts of individuals for which they cannot be regarded as jointly and severally responsible.&lt;br /&gt;Art. 51. No contribution shall be collected except under a written order, and on the responsibility of a commander-in-chief.&lt;br /&gt;The collection of the said contribution shall only be effected as far as possible in accordance with the rules of assessment and incidence of the taxes in force.&lt;br /&gt;For every contribution a receipt shall be given to the contributors.&lt;br /&gt;Art. 52. Requisitions in kind and services shall not be demanded from municipalities or inhabitants except for the needs of the army of occupation. They shall be in proportion to the resources of the country, and of such a nature as not to involve the inhabitants in the obligation of taking part in military operations against their own country.&lt;br /&gt;Such requisitions and services shall only be demanded on the authority of the commander in the locality occupied.&lt;br /&gt;Contributions in kind shall as far as possible be paid for in cash; if not, a receipt shall be given and the payment of the amount due shall be made as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;Art. 53. An army of occupation can only take possession of cash, funds, and realizable securities which are strictly the property of the State, depots of arms, means of transport, stores and supplies, and, generally, all movable property belonging to the State which may be used for military operations . . .&lt;br /&gt;Art. 55. The occupying State shall be regarded only as administrator and usufructuary of public buildings, real estate, forests, and agricultural estates belonging to the hostile State, and situated in the occupied country. It must safeguard the capital of these properties, and administer them in accordance with the rules of usufruct.&lt;br /&gt;Art. 56. The property of municipalities, that of institutions dedicated to religion, charity and education, the arts and sciences, even when State property, shall be treated as private property.&lt;br /&gt;All seizure of, destruction or wilful damage done to institutions of this character, historic monuments, works of art and science, is forbidden, and should be made the subject of legal proceedings.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Breaking News: 15 US Soldiers Killed, 21 Injured in Helicopter Attack&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guerrillas used SAM-7 shoulder-fired missiles to down a CH-47 Chinook transport helicopter south of Fallujah.  The troops, so many of whom were tragically killed or wounded, were being taken out of the deadly Sunni Arab triangle for much needed rest and recreation.  There are reputedly thousands of SAM-7 missiles and shoulder-held missile launchers in Iraq.  Only a few hundred have been turned in for a reward by Iraqis or captured by US forces.  Guerrilla's have routinely fired SAM-7 missiles at aircraft attempting to land at Baghdad International Airport, but have been foiled by the special technique of spiral landings, executed by smaller aircraft, which makes them very difficult targets.  Some say there have been 28 such attacks in recent months!  One reason the airport has not opened to civilian airliners is that the airliners cannot execute these tight spiral landings and so would be vulnerable to a missile strike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Local inhabitants in Fallujah celebrated the downing, blessing the &quot;freedom fighters&quot; fighting &quot;the American occupation.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the second helicopter shot down in the past week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.news-journal.com/news/content/news/ap_story.html/National/AP.V0932.AP-Iraq-Fort-Carso.html;COXnetJSessionID=1lfBGxFACPsyymt0oBztj4uZ1KwO2N1oeXO8pmEaKtg0E5wgLWtt!-1792961607?urac=n&amp;urvf=10678024331780.3506167565712729&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.news-journal.com/news/content/news/&lt;br /&gt;ap_story.html/National/AP.V0932.AP-Iraq-&lt;br /&gt;Fort-Carso.html;COXnetJSessionID=1lfBGxFACP&lt;br /&gt;syymt0oBztj4uZ1KwO2N1oeXO8pmEaKtg0E5wg&lt;br /&gt;LWtt!-1792961607?urac=n&amp;urvf=106780243317&lt;br /&gt;80.3506167565712729&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more on the SAM-7 strikes at Baghdad airport:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/specialreports/iraq/s_161517.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/&lt;br /&gt;tribune-review/specialreports/iraq/&lt;br /&gt;s_161517.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;2 US Soldiers Killed in Mosul, 2 Wounded; Baghdad Partially Closed&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guerrillas in Mosul set off bombs as US soldiers drove by in two sport utility vehicles, killing two of the soldiers and wounding two others.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guerrilla threats of violence paralyzed Baghdad on Saturday.  Many shops did not open, many children were not sent to school, and many government workers did not come into their offices.  Traffic in the city was light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The purpose of such guerrilla calls for strikes is to create a sense of solidarity between them and the people, and to create an image that there is a social movement against the occupation rather than merely a few guerrillas blowing up an occasional bomb.  These tactics worked very well in Algeria in the 1950s, for instance, but I doubt they will be effective in Iraq for at least a year or too.  Most people still hate the Baathists too much to join them, and are giving the Americans a honeymoon.  It won't last forever, though.</description>

      <title>Bremer Promises shortened Timetable for turning ov ...</title>
      <link>http://www.japantoday.com/e/?content=news&amp;cat=8&amp;id=277689</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Bremer Promises shortened Timetable for turning over Sovereignty&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First Jay Garner said he wanted to turn control of Iraq over to the Iraqis (mainly to Ahmad Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress) within six months.  (That would have been around now).  Then Bremer came in to replace Garner, and said he would rule Iraq himself for two years or so.  Even after he finally caved in and appointed an Interim Governing Council on June 13, the IGC complained that the Americans kept saying they would not be given real power for &quot;18 months.&quot;  So Bremer's target date was something like Jan. 1, 2005, at that point, rather than the two or three years he began with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Bremer is saying that the US will accelerate the formation of a new Iraqi army and police, and will try to turn over sovereignty to the Iraqis much more quickly.  Some US officials have expressed hope that the civil administration could be turned over to an Iraqi government as early as summer, 2004.  Surely the Bush administration desire to be shut of Iraq at least in appearances before the November 2004 elections must play a part in these hopes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that I can't imagine a constitution being written and elections being held by summer of 2004.  Bremer earlier had said a new constitutution must be written before elections can be held.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn't it be ironic if he were stuck in Iraq for a full two years, the term for which he initially boasted he would  rule by fiat, when he increasingly wanted desperately to get back on something more like Garner's withdrawal schedule?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The low-grade guerrilla resitance against the US is not militarily significant.  But it is politically highly significant.  Doctors without Borders moved from Baghdad to Amman on Saturday.  And these guys are tough.  They worked in Afghanistan under the Taliban when they could.  The NGOs are deserting the US in Iraq.  Plus, the US public doesn't like hearing about a new American death every other day.  And, they don't like the sound of that $87 bn bill for Iraq that came on top of the spring $66 bn bill, and may proceed yet another such bill.  People like Bush have been fanning distrust of government spending and complaining about welfare queens for years, but now those chickens are coming home to roost.  Iraq looks like one big welfare queen from Peoria, and Bush looks like her no-good absentee husband.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.japantoday.com/e/?content=news&amp;cat=8&amp;id=277689&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.japantoday.com/e/&lt;br /&gt;?content=news&amp;cat=8&amp;id=277689&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[On Wolf Blitzer's CNN show Sunday, Bremer said he hoped a new constitution could be written by summer or fall of 2004, but seemed to imply that it depended on the Interim Governing Council finding a way to call a constitutional convention within the next month.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Raucous Celebrations in Kirkuk at Kurd as President; 5 Dead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odd rotating presidency of the Interim Governing Council, whereby 9 of the 25 members take turns for one month each as leaders of the country, has now fallen on Jalal Talabani, 69.  The leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan is popular in eastern Iraqi Kurdistan, starting in Sulaimaniya, and controls about 25,000 paramilitary fighters (peshmerga).  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, the celebratory gunfire in Kirkuk was so extensive that 5 people are said to have been killed by it.&lt;br /&gt;AFP reported, &quot;&lt;i&gt;“This is a historical day in the lives of the Kurds who have been seeking hard to achieve their dream to rule Iraq and let their voice be heard in the world,” said businessman Serdal Sader.  Hiwa Fateh Ahmad, 46, called on Talabani “to seek to allow the Kurds to regain their due rights and grant them compensation for the years of repression and killings.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <title>Wolfowitz on Shiite contacts in Iraq; and on How H ...</title>
      <link>http://www.dod.mil/transcripts/2003/tr20031030-depsecdef0833.html</link>
      <description>&lt;b&gt;Wolfowitz on Shiite contacts in Iraq; and on How He is the Only Patriot&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz talked Friday at Georgetown about his recent trip to Iraq, during which his life was put in danger by a missile attack on the hotel where he was staying.  He spoke of his meetings with Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, leader of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;As I said earlier, it doesn't take many people, sometimes only one or two, to set a bomb that can kill scores or hundreds.  That happened in the Shia holy city of Najaf two months ago and it killed a very important Shia leader -- Ayatollah Bakar al Hakim.  That was big news, but I believe the more important news was the aftermath, and the incredibly restrained response of the Shia community to that shocking event.  Sunday night I was privileged to have dinner in Baghdad with the younger brother, the last surviving brother by the way of Ayatollah Mohammed al Hakim.  His name is Abdul Aziz al Hakim.  It was an extraordinary three hours.  It was impossible not to be impressed by this man's intelligence, his sense of humor, and his understated courage.  He is the last of seven brothers.  The first six, counting his recently martyred brother, who were murdered by agents of the old regime.  They are among 63 members of his family who he says were victims of Saddam and his thugs.   Today Abdul Aziz al Hakim is a member of the new Governing Council of Iraq, and he said to me, and he laughed when he said it, that he did not himself want to become number 64.  Anyone who can laugh at something like that has a strong sense of humor.  But most impressive was his humanity and the conviction with which he spoke of his and his family's commitment to religious freedom.  He told about how his recently murdered brother had intervened with Iranian authorities in Iran to permit Iraqi Christian prisoners of war to assemble to celebrate Christmas, and how his brother, a senior Shia cleric, had joined them for Christmas.  When his brother died, hundreds of Christians came by to pay condolences, many of them weeping unconsolably.  As Adbul Aziz al Hakim observed to me on Sunday, quite shrewdly, &quot;It might be possible for a few of them to be pretending, but certainly not all.&quot;   He then went on to talk about how their late father is described in the history of modern Iraq as having defended the Jews of Iraq even after 1967, when it became particularly difficult and dangerous. This man clearly comes from a family that boasts of courage and tolerance, and he stands firmly in their tradition.   Let me hasten to add, before I once again get unfairly accused of painting rosy scenarios, that I don't believe that the person I talked to was necessarily a saint or that I can judge everything from a three hour dinner.  I don't necessarily know that everyone in his organization shares the views that he expressed to me. And I imagine if we probed deeper that he and I would disagree, just as he would disagree with many Americans, about some important questions about the role of religion in society, or the role of women in society. It's not perfect. But with leaders like that, particularly coming from the Shia clerical community, which so many people have told us we have so much to fear from, I think in fact there is strong reason to be hopeful.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This picture of the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq and its leaders is not just rosey but frankly bizarre.  They did lead what was essentially a terrorist organization from Tehran, hitting Iraqi government targets from across the border, for 20 years.  They were close to Ayatollah Khomeini (did they speak out about his mistreatment of religious minorities, including Jews and Baha'is?) and then to hardliner Ali Khamenei.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wrote of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim for &lt;i&gt;Le Monde Diplomatique&lt;/i&gt; last summer that on April 18 &quot;he gave an interview from Kut with Iranian television in which he laid out his party's two-stage plan for Iraq.  He said, &quot;We will first opt for a national political system,&quot; in which all parties and sects were represented.  He continued, &quot;but eventually the Iraqi people will seek an Islamic republic system.&quot;  He added that in a democratic system, the will of the Shiites for an Islamic government would prevail, since they are 60 percent of the population.  That is, SCIRI plans to begin with a representative government but ultimately to move to a tyranny of the Shiite majority, whether the Sunnis and secularists like it or not.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abdul Aziz has also called for the immediate withdrawal of US troops from Iraq.  Although Wolfowitz keeps talking about women's rights in Iraq, he seems blithely unaware that Baath secularism was much better on that particular issue than the positions of people like Abdul Aziz al-Hakim will ever be, and that his friends the hardline Shiite clerics will do everything they can to withdraw rights from women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another topic, I thought this exchange was telling:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A student asked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;I&gt;Q:  I'd just like to say that people like Ruthy and myself have always opposed Saddam Hussein, especially when Saddam Hussein was being funded by the United States throughout the '80s.  And -- [Applause]  And after the killings of the Kurds when the United States increased aid to Iraq.  We were there opposing him as well.  People like us were there.  We are for democracy.  And I have a question.  What do you plan to do when Bush is defeated in 2004 and you will no longer have the power to push forward the project for New American Century's policy of American military and economic dominance over the people of the world?  [Applause]&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; Wolfowitz:  I don't know if it was just Freudian or you intended to say it that way, but you said you opposed Saddam Hussein especially when the United States supported him.  It seems to me that the north star of your comment is that you dislike this country and its policies.  [Applause]  And it seems to me a time to have supported the United States and to push the United States harder was in 1991 when Saddam Hussein was slaughtering those innocents so viciously.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, as a historian I try to be as even-handed as I can, and I don't like to demonize people.  There are things I admire about Paul Wolfowitz.  But this exchange is just so ugly and ruthless that it made my blood boil when I read it.  Wolfowitz doesn't seem to get it, that the student is referring to the period 1983-1990 when the US was a close ally of Saddam's, when it authorized the sale of chemical and biological precursors to Saddam, when it had the US navy function essentially as an auxiliary of Saddam's military.  Either he didn't get it or he was using misdirection to shift attention away from his own former alliance with Saddam (I wonder if he's managed to have all those files shredded?)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is bad enough.  But then he said, &lt;b&gt;&quot;It seems to me that the north star of your comment is that you dislike this country and its policies.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;  And you know, I want to puke at a statement like that.  Objecting to the Bush administration's policies is not the same as to &quot;dislike this country.&quot;  That is sickening demagoguery.  Objecting to the Reagan-Bush alliance with Saddam, of which Wolfowitz was part given that he served in those administrations, is &lt;i&gt;certainly&lt;/i&gt; not unpatriotic.  In any case, Paul Wolfowitz does not own this country.  He does not have a patent on patriotism.  No one appointed him High Inquisitioner to examine the consciences of other Americans.  That comment was despicable.  And I guarantee you, it will come back to haunt him.  Because charges of working against the interests of your own country are very slippery things, and may get the one making the charges hoisted by his own petard someday.  Nixon used to pull that crap too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dod.mil/transcripts/2003/tr20031030-depsecdef0833.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.dod.mil/transcripts/&lt;br /&gt;2003/tr20031030-depsecdef0833.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Two US Soldiers, 20 Iraqis Wounded in Baghdad Firefight&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two US soldiers were wounded on Friday in Abu Gharib, Baghdad.  Guerrillas in the area had tossed grenades at US forces.  The US army responded by doing search and discover operations, supported by tanks.  One tank accidentally ran over a six-year-old boy.  His death provoked locals to fire at the US forces and the Iraqi police.  They killed an Iraqi policeman and wounded the two US soldiers.  The army returned fire, wounding 20 Iraqis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Fallujah, a crowd gathered in front of the municipal building to demand that the offices, which had been targeted by guerrillas, be moved.  When the crowd invaded the building, Iraqi police fired on them, killing one man.  In response, friends or relatives of the man fired rocket-propelled grenades and assault rifles at the Municipal building, infuriated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Near Baqubah, two Iraqi civilians were killed by a land mine that had been planted near a US base.  Also near Baqaubah, US troops shot a farmer to death while he was watering his fields, perhaps mistaking him for a guerrilla.</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Preachers denounce IGC; Sistani calls for Disarming of the Militias&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani called Friday for the country's militias to be disarmed. He said a new Iraqi army needed to be established as soon as possible, and that the soldiers of the old army should be called back to duty where they had not committed any atrocities (al-Zaman).  Al-Zaman also says that there was a wave of sermons Friday against the Interim Governing Council.  Some clerics castigated the US-appointed body as the instrument of Satan or as unable to establish security.  &lt;br /&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;Mudarrisi Calls for Withdrawal of Coalition Troops&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ayatollah Muhammad Taqi Mudarrisi of Karbala, leader of the Islamic Action Party, called Friday for withdrawal of coalition troops frm Iraq.  He said the framing of a new constitution and the holding of elections for an Iraqi government should allow Coalition troops to go home.  He said Shiites would &quot;change their strategy&quot; after the recent clashes in Karbala.  He warned that should the leading Shiite clerics issue an appeal, the population would rise up against the occupiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.albawaba.com/news/index.php3?sid=262303&amp;lang=e&amp;dir=news&quot;&gt;http://www.albawaba.com/news/&lt;br /&gt;index.php3?sid=262303&amp;lang=e&amp;dir=news&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;b&gt;WP:  Crackdown on Muqtada al-Sadr Imminent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Ignatius argues that the US still plans to crack down on Shiite radical Muqtada al-Sadr and his movement.  He says the Pentagon feels that in the firefights between the Sadrist Army of the Mahdi and US troops recently in East Baghdad and Karbala, Muqtada &quot;crossed a line.&quot;  They recognize that moving against him will cause trouble with some proportion of the Shiite community.  Gen. John Abizaid, US military commander in Iraq, is said to have apprehensions about the plan because it could upset the South, which has not been as big a security problem for the Coalition as the Sunni Arab triangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44854-2003Oct30.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/&lt;br /&gt;articles/A44854-2003Oct30.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description>
